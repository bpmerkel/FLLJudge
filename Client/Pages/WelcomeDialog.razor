            Although <i>FIRST</i> LEGO League judges have 10 minutes to deliberate
            and record their assessments on the rubrics, judges often confess that 10 minutes
            isn't enough time to generate comments for the bottom of the rubric forms.
            This app is a solution for judges to view common comments, and use them as a template
            to transcribe to their rubric forms.

            To use the app, follow these steps:
            <ol class="indented">
                <li>Launch the application in a modern browser, such as Chrome or Edge (the browser needs to support WebAssembly--a capability to run web apps).</li>
                <li>
                    The app should show three tabs for the judging areas of a <i>FIRST</i> LEGO League tournament--'Core Values', 'Innovation Project', and 'Robot Design'.
                    Choose the tab that represents the area of judging for which you need to write comments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A list of common comments is listed... scan the list to identify a comment you think resonates
                    with the team you just observed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To help rapidly identify a comment, use the 'chips' at the top of the list to
                    highlight comment terms. The chips are generated from frequent terms used in the comments.
                </li>
                <li>Optionally click (or press) on each comment you want to include... this will show a badge on the tab with the count of comments you identified.</li>
                <li>Use the 'Show Selections' toggle to filter the lists to only the comments you selected.</li>
                <li>Use the 'Clear All' button to reset your selections.</li>
                <li>When it comes time to transcribe the comments to your rubric pages, simply reference the comments you selected.</li>
            </ol>
